A library for rendering text with [paranim](https://github.com/paranim/paranim). It uses [STB](https://github.com/nothings/stb) truetype to rasterize a font into a bitmap, and then provides a way to render text with instanced rendering. See [the example](https://github.com/paranim/paranim/blob/master/examples/src/ex27_text.nim) to learn how to use it.
